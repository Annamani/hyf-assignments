3.How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
-using Copilot to generate code:
It generates the code quickly after i prompt a message.

-using it as an effective learning partner

I can choose Copilot as a learning partner instead of coding faster.
so i can learn deeply and explore things with examples to understand it in better way.

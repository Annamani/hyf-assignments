### Instructions:

#### 1. **Marinate the Chicken:**

* In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam
masala, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for better flavor).

#### 2. **Cook the Rice:**

* Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
* In a large pot, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add cloves, cardamom, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and salt.
* Add the rice to the boiling water, and cook it for about 5-7 minutes until it is 70-80% cooked. The rice should still
be firm. Drain the water and set the rice aside.

#### 3. **Prepare the Biryani:**

* In a large, heavy-bottomed pan or a Dutch oven, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat.
* Add cumin seeds and sauté them for a few seconds. Then, add the sliced onions and fry them until golden brown and
crispy (set aside some fried onions for garnish).
* Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute.
* Add the marinated chicken along with the marinade. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 10-12 minutes until it is
partially cooked (it will finish cooking while layering).
* Add chopped tomatoes, coriander powder, garam masala, red chili powder, and salt to taste. Cook for another 5 minutes
until the tomatoes soften.

#### 4. **Layer the Biryani:**

* Reduce the heat to low. Start layering the biryani by adding half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken.
* Sprinkle some chopped coriander, mint leaves, and saffron milk (if using) over the rice.
* Add the remaining rice on top, followed by more chopped herbs and fried onions for garnish.

#### 5. **Cook the Biryani:**

* Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal it with dough (optional, but helps trap the steam).
* Cook the biryani on low heat (you can place a heavy pan or tava beneath the pot to avoid direct heat) for 20-25
minutes.
* After the biryani is cooked, let it rest for 10 minutes before opening the lid.

#### 6. **Serve:**

* Gently fluff the biryani with a fork and serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or a side salad.

Enjoy your flavorful, aromatic chicken biryani!

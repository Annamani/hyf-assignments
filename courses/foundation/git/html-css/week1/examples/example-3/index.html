                        The Adršpach Rocks look the way they do today thanks to the power of water.
                        All the way back during the Lower Palaeozoic Era,
                        a depression was created here, in which the sea and
                        rivers left behind their sediment. Over the following years,
                        the sea withdrew on several occasions and the land was lifted
                        and eroded by the movements of the earth’s crust.
                        When the sea withdrew, the land left behind became today’s City of Rocks.
                        Then, the natural elements came into play, forces such as frosts, running water,
                        the wind, and the sun, and they formed the sandstone rocks into
                        what we know them as today. </p>

                        on top of Mount Ještěd near Liberec in the Czech Republic. Measuring 94 m (308 ft),
                        it is made of reinforced concrete shaped in a "hyperboloid" form.
                        The tower was designed by architect Karel Hubáček, who was assisted by Zdeněk Patrman,
                        involved in building statics, and by Otakar Binar, who designed the interior furnishing.
                        It took the team three years to finalize the structure design (1963–1966).
                        The construction itself took seven years to finish (1966–1973).</p>

                    the country,there is so much to explore and discover.

                    During my recent trip to the Czech Republic, I had the opportunity to visit
                    some of the country's most iconic landmarks,including the Charles Bridge, Prague Castle,
                    and the Old Town Square.
                    One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the Jested tower and snezka mountain.
                    I also had the chance to explore the beautiful countryside surrounding the town,
                    which was filled with rolling hills, lush forests,and quaint villages.

                    Overall, my trip to the Czech Republic was an unforgettable experience
                    that I will cherish for years to come.
